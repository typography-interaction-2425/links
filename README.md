## Project 4: Links

This is an [Are.na API](https://dev.are.na/documentation/channels) demo repo for the fourth project in [*Typography and Interaction*](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io):

> Students will collaboratively assemble, connect, and present a collection using [Are.na](https://www.are.na) as a platform/<wbr>Content Management System (CMS)—and will then design and build an interface to explore and understand it, using their Application Programming Interface (API).
